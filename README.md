# Forum-Frontend
This is the frontend for my main repo [Forumeong](https://github.com/Sunset-06/Forumeong)
Built using React with Typescript.

This handles the authenticaton cient-side, so you would find the code here. Just add your env file and it should run.

after cloning, use: 
```
npm install
``` 
to run the dev server use: 
```
npm run dev
```

to create a production build, use:
```
npm run build
```
then transfer the contents of the 'dist' directory to the backend.
